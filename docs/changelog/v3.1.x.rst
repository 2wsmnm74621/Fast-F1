What's new in v3.1.0
--------------------

(released 02/05/2023)

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Added additional circuit information that includes the location of corners,
  marshal lights, marshal sectors and the rotation of the track map. This
  data is available through :func:`fastf1.core.Session.get_circuit_info`. Also
  check out the new examples that show how to annotate your plots using this
  data.
  A huge thank you to @multiviewer (https://multiviewer.app/) for providing
  this information through MultiViewer's API.

- "SessionInfo" data from the F1 livetiming API is now available through
  :attr:`fastf1.core.Session.session_info`
